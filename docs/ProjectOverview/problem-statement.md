# Problem Statement

## The Key Challenges

Engineering colleges affiliated with Osmania University faced significant challenges in accessing and analyzing academic results effectively. Our research identified that these problems affected **students**, **teachers**, **head of department**, and **college administrators** the most.

---

## Primary Problems Identified

### 1. Limited Access & Visibility

!!! warning "Core Issues"
    - Results only accessible via individual hall ticket numbers
    - Results scattered across multiple, temporary university URLs.
    - No comprehensive view of batch, department, or college performance
    - Manual result checking is a time consuming process
    - Server overload during result announcement days
    - Faculty and administration lack insight into department or college-wide performance for improvements.
    - Difficulty in decision-making on re-evaluation due to lack of impact analysis.

### 2. Data Fragmentation

| **Problem Area** | **Description** | **Impact** |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Scattered Links** | New URLs for each semester | Historical data inaccessible |
| **Link Expiration** | Result links expire over time | Permanent data loss |
| **No Aggregation** | Individual result silos | No comparative analysis possible |

## Real-World Scenarios

### Student Perspective
> *"I spent hours manually checking results of my classmates to understand where I stand.*

---

> *"There was no way to know if paying for revaluation would improve my CGPA meaningfully."*


---

### Faculty Perspective  
> *"We couldn't identify which subjects were consistently challenging for students or compare our department's performance with others. This limited our ability to improve teaching methods."*

---

### Administrative Perspective
> *"Without aggregated data, we couldn't make informed decisions about curriculum changes, faculty development, or resource allocation."*

!!!warning "Current systems provide only isolated data per student, limit transparency, and hinder both academic self-assessment and institutional improvement."
